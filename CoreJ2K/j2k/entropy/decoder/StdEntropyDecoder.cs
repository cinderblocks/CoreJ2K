	/// <summary> This class implements the JPEG 2000 entropy decoder, which codes stripes in
	/// code-blocks. This entropy decoding engine decodes one code-block at a time.
	/// 
	/// The code-blocks are rectangular and their dimensions must be powers of
	/// 2. Each dimension cannot be smaller than 4 and larger than 256. The product
	/// of the two dimensions (i.e. area of the code-block) cannot exceed 4096.
	/// 
	/// Context 0 of the MQ-coder is used as the uniform one (uniform,
	/// non-adaptive probability distribution). Context 1 is used for RLC
	/// coding. Contexts 2-10 are used for zero-coding (ZC), contexts 11-15 are
	/// used for sign-coding (SC) and contexts 16-18 are used for
	/// magnitude-refinement (MR).
	/// 
	/// This implementation also provides some timing features. They can be
	/// enabled by setting the 'DO_TIMING' constant of this class to true and
	/// recompiling. The timing uses the 'System.currentTimeMillis()' Java API
	/// call, which returns wall clock time, not the actual CPU time used. The
	/// timing results will be printed on the message output. Since the times
	/// reported are wall clock times and not CPU usage times they can not be added
	/// to find the total used time (i.e. some time might be counted in several
	/// places). When timing is disabled ('DO_TIMING' is false) there is no penalty
	/// if the compiler performs some basic optimizations. Even if not the penalty
	/// should be negligeable.
